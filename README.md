Description
We want you to implement a simple player integration that will change the playing video based on the content a user selects.

Implement a simple HTML5 video player.
The video player should atleast have the default controls set.
Get dummy data from https://api.myjson.com/bins/so5pk
Render the poster data to your page.
Style rendered posters accordingly to the example.
When the user press on the poster start the poster video.
When the user is hovering over the poster show the description of the poster next to the cursor.
Make sure that the description follows the cursor.
Make sure that the description does not get out of window.
When the user leaves the poster with the cursor hide the description.
When the user press on the currently playing poster do not reload the video.
When the user uses the implementation on a samller screen the application should be responsive and adapt to screen size.
